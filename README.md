TSP
===

A few algorithms for TSP. Задача коммивояжера.


`input.txt` - the initial graph as a rectangle 
`generator.py`  - genereates a random graph in `input.txt`
`main.py` - contains algoritms for finding the solution of Travelling Salesman Problem.
`closer.py` - a realization of closer path algorytm in the initial graph
`fact.py` - just a factorial finder
`statistics.sh` - creates all js files and for showing statistics of different alghorith solutions
